This project implements an Artificial Neural Network machine learning algorithm to predict the compressive
strength of concrete. 

The data are separated into training and test sets and all models are evaluated for predictive accuracy and SSE.

The resulting graphs and neural networks can be viewed by going to the following URL: https://imgur.com/a/foV4O

Data used for this analysis can be downloaded via UC Irvine's machine learning repository
